## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes on API-Based Sources

Some sources from your original table require API keys and are **not RSS-based**:

### **Requires API Integration (Future Enhancement)**
1. **NewsAPI.org** - JSON API (100 req/day free)
2. **Finnhub.io** - JSON API (real-time news)
3. **MarketAux.com** - JSON API (100 req/day)
4. **Polygon.io** - JSON API (you already have API key for prices)
5. **FinancialModelingPrep** - JSON API (250 calls/day)

These would require:
- New API client implementations
- Rate limiting logic
- Different data models (JSON vs RSS)
- Separate polling logic

**Recommendation**: Start with RSS feeds first, then add API sources in Phase 2.

## üîß Technical Details

### **Database Schema**
The `Source` model supports the new feeds without changes:
```python
class Source(Base, TimestampMixin):
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    url = Column(String, unique=True, nullable=False)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    source_type = Column(String, default="rss")
    enabled = Column(Boolean, default=True)
    last_fetched_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)
```

### **Polling Frequency**
- Current: Every 15 minutes (900 seconds)
- With 20 feeds: ~45 seconds per feed per cycle
- No changes needed to scheduler

### **Rate Limiting**
- RSS feeds have no strict rate limits
- Browser-like headers already configured
- Retry logic with exponential backoff in place

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **Review the expanded feed list** - Confirm which feeds you want to add
2. **I'll update the seed file** - Replace `seed_sources.json` with expanded version
3. **I'll add feeds to database** - Use API to add feeds immediately
4. **Monitor ingestion** - Verify feeds are working correctly
5. **Adjust if needed** - Disable any problematic feeds

**Ready to proceed?** Let me know if you want to:
- Add all 10 new feeds
- Add only specific feeds (tell me which ones)
- Modify any feed URLs or names
