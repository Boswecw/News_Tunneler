   - Forward return calculation
   - Index-beating detection
   - Automatic labeling pipeline

5. **‚úÖ ML Training Pipeline**

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Ingest Signals

Send trading signals to the system:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/signals/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "signals": [
      {
        "symbol": "AAPL",
        "t": 1730138358674,
        "features": {
          "sentiment": 0.8,
          "magnitude": 0.45,
          "credibility": 0.9
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### 2. Get Top Signals

Retrieve the highest-scoring signals:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/signals/top?limit=10
```

### 3. Get Latest Signal for a Symbol

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/signals/AAPL/latest
```

### 4. Label Signals

Run the labeling task to calculate forward returns:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/admin/label
```

### 5. Train the Model

Once you have 50+ labeled signals:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/admin/train
```

## üîß API Endpoints

### Signal Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/signals/ingest` | Ingest new signals |
| GET | `/signals/top` | Get top-scoring signals |
| GET | `/signals/{symbol}/latest` | Get latest signal for symbol |

### Admin Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/admin/label` | Label signals with forward returns |
| POST | `/admin/train` | Train ML model |

---

## üìà Signal Scoring

Signals are scored 0-100 based on:

1. **Sentiment** (0-1): News sentiment polarity
2. **Magnitude** (0-1): Size of the move/event
3. **Credibility** (0-1): Source reliability
4. **Recency** (0-1): How recent the signal is
5. **Volume** (0-1): Trading volume spike

### Labels

- **High-Conviction**: Score ‚â• 70
- **Opportunity**: Score ‚â• 50 and < 70
- **Watch**: Score < 50

---

## üéì ML Training

The system trains a logistic regression model to predict which signals will beat the market.

### Requirements
- Minimum 50 labeled signals
- At least 10 positive examples (signals that beat the index)

### Training Process
1. Signals are labeled with 1-day forward returns
2. Compared against S&P 500 performance
3. Model learns optimal feature weights
4. Weights saved to `data/model_weights.json`

### Model Metrics
After training, you'll see:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC AUC

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Polygon Rate Limits

If you hit rate limits:
```bash
# Switch to Yahoo Finance
USE_PRICE_SOURCE=yahoo
```

### Missing Labels

If signals aren't being labeled:
```bash
# Manually trigger labeling
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/admin/label
```

### Training Fails

Common issues:
- Not enough labeled signals (need 50+)
- Not enough positive examples (need 10+)
- Missing price data for some symbols

---

## üìä Next Steps

1. **Accumulate Data**: Ingest signals over time to build training dataset
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track which signals actually beat the market
3. **Train Model**: Once you have 50+ labeled signals, train the model
4. **Iterate**: Retrain periodically as new data comes in
5. **Integrate**: Use signal scores in your trading strategy

## üéâ Success!

Your trading signals system is ready to:
- ‚úÖ Ingest and score trading signals
- ‚úÖ Fetch real-time prices from Polygon.io
- ‚úÖ Label signals with forward returns
- ‚úÖ Train ML models to predict winners
- ‚úÖ Provide explainable scoring

Happy trading! üöÄüìà
